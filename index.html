          <p>This 335-line program calculates the area (or the Riemann sum) under the curve of a chosen mathematical function with given limits. The function's graph and the rectangles between the limits of integration get drawn to a canvas. There are 16 different functions to choose from with a sliding scale to zoom in and out of the graph.</p>

          <p><b>Bubble sort</b> is a sorting algorithm that steps through a list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm iterates through the list until all of the items are in order.</p>

          <p><b>Quicksort</b> is a divide and conquer algorithm with the same goals as bubble sort as to organize the items inside the list. The algorithm partitions the list into three sections by making recursive calls. <b>Recursion</b> is when a function gets called from within itself.</p>

          <p>Like quicksort, merge sort is another divide and conquer algorithm. Merge sort divides the list into multiple sub-lists until each sublist is a single element. The sub-lists get merged back, which results in a sorted list. The algorithm is one of the most efficient algorithms, with a runtime of O(n * logn).</p>

          <p>This program visualizes the behavior of the <b>stack</b>. A stack is a data structure that contains a collection of items with two primary operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top (or end) of the list (when the stack is not full). Pop removes the item from the same area (when it is not empty). Therefore, the following two mnemonics best describe stacks: FILO (First In, Last Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out).</p>

          <p>This program is an interactive visualization of the <b>queue</b>, similar to the stack program. A queue is a data structure that (like the stack) contains a collection of items and has two operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds elements to the list sequentially, while dequeue removes the front-most item in the group. The queue's associative mnemonic is FIFO (First In, First Out). A real-world example of a queue is the check-out at a grocery store.</p>

          <p>Also known as Euler's phi (ϕ) function, <b>Euler's totient function</b> counts the positive integers of a given number that are relatively prime to that number. This program calculates the phi function of the first 50 integers. Each circle displayed graphically is an integer that does not share common factors with the number. For example, consider the prime number 47. Since 47 does not share a factor with any number, there is a vertical line of circles. Thus, ϕ(47) = 46. In addition to the graph, a drop-down is available to view the phi function for the first 50 integers.</p>

          <p>Visualization of Conway's Game of Life (a cellular automaton), a playerless game such that its evolution is given by its initial state, requiring no other input. Every white square is a cell, depending on its orientation with its eight neighbors surrounding the cell, changes based on rules. For example, Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbor cells dies (as if by underpopulation). Rules of the game are similar to cell biology (and falls under cellular automata).</p>

      <p>This 200-line object-oriented program visualizes the exercise data that I collected from the Pacer app. The data collection spans over two and a half years. The program utilizes file output to grab the data from a CSV file. Bubble size is pre-determined by the number of steps for a given day. Under the bubbles section is an animated bar chart, which displays the bar at the same as its corresponding bubble. At the end of the animation, a summary gets printed. The frame rate can change via a slider, as well as a reset button can restart the animation. Over 1000 objects instantiated.</p>
