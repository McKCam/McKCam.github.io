          <p>This 335-line program calculates the area (or the Riemann sum) under the curve of a chosen mathematical function with given limits. The function's graph and the rectangles between the limits of integration get drawn to a canvas. There are 16 different functions to choose from with a sliding scale to zoom in and out of the graph.</p>

          <p>Similar to the previous program, this project animates the rectangles forming (and transforming) under the curve. The area also updates as shapes get added.</p>

          <p>This program visualizes the behavior of the <b>stack</b>. A stack is a data structure that contains a collection of items with two primary operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top (or end) of the list (when the stack is not full). Pop removes the item from the same area (when it is not empty). Therefore, the following two mnemonics best describe stacks: FILO (First In, Last Out) and LIFO (Last In, First Out).</p>

          <p>This program is an interactive visualization of the <b>queue</b>, similar to the stack program. A queue is a data structure that (like the stack) contains a collection of items and has two operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds elements to the list sequentially, while dequeue removes the front-most item in the group. The queue's associative mnemonic is FIFO (First In, First Out). A real-world example of a queue is the check-out at a grocery store.</p>

          <p>Also known as Euler's phi (ϕ) function, <b>Euler's totient function</b> counts the positive integers of a given number that are relatively prime to that number. This program calculates the phi function of the first 50 integers. Each circle displayed graphically is an integer that does not share common factors with the number. For example, consider the prime number 47. Since 47 does not share a factor with any number, there is a vertical line of circles. Thus, ϕ(47) = 46. In addition to the graph, a drop-down is available to view the phi function for the first 50 integers.</p>

          <p>For every recursive call this program makes, it adds a smaller triangle within the previous triangle. There were approximately 21 recursive function calls made for this program. Unlike the previous recursive programs, this one is animated.</p>

        <p>My independent project for Professor Yarbrough's Fall 2020 MATH 2110 Calculus III course. A visualization of multivariable integeration of the function 2x + y via numerical methods. Uses WEBGL for 3D visuals. Has an orbit control feature to look at the volume from different perspectives and a zoom in/out slider. There is also a show function checkbox that shows the plane, as well as a slider below the checkbox to change the color of the plane.</p>

      <p>This 200-line object-oriented program visualizes the exercise data that I collected from the Pacer app. The data collection spans over two and a half years. The program utilizes file output to grab the data from a CSV file. Bubble size is pre-determined by the number of steps for a given day. Under the bubbles section is an animated bar chart, which displays the bar at the same as its corresponding bubble. At the end of the animation, a summary gets printed. The frame rate can change via a slider, as well as a reset button can restart the animation. Over 1000 objects instantiated.</p>
